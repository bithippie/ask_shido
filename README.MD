# What it can do
- Mention `@Shido` to print usage instructions.
- Have `@Shido ask` you a question.
- You can add a question to the pool with `@Shido pose <your question>`
- When `@Shido` responds to an `ask` request by providing a question. `#Channel` members can react with `üëç`  `üëé` or other emojis to bubble the best questions to the top.
- `#Channel` members can `reply` to an `ask` using `@Shido <reply>` from within the thread. **Note: Replies outside the thread are ignored.**
- Set an automatic `ask`, using `/remind`. E.g. `/remind #shido "@Shido ask" every Monday at 10 am`.
